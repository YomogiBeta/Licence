PM-MP Plugin      Licence Authentication

You do not have to inform everyone that "Please go to the rule room and read the rules".
Because it seems to display the screen of "Do you agree with the terms of service?" Seen in many services.

After installing this plugin, UI will be displayed to the user who logged in for the first time.

•If you do not agree
You can't use this server. You will be kicked by this plugin.

•If you do agree
You can use this server.Thereafter, it will not be redisplayed unless you delete the Player.yml.

Finally, I am Japanese and I am not very good at English. So please forgive me for relying on Google Translate
